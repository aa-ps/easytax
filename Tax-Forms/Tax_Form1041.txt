The 1041 Tax Form is used to report fiduciary of a domestic decedent's estate, trust, or bankruptcy estate.

Here are a few examples of what can be reported:

1) The income, deductions, gains, losses, etc. of the estate or trust.

2) The income that is either accumulated or held for future distribution or distributed currently to the beneficiaries.

3) Any income tax liability of the estate or trust.

4) Employment taxes on wages paid to household employees.
